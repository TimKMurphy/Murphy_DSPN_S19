    "### <b>Background</b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Older children and adults have a particularly difficult time precieving speech sounds not found in their native language. These difficulties often make learning a second language (L2) difficult, especially if the L2 speech sounds differ substantially from those in the learner's native language (Wang et. al. (2003), Chandrasekaran et. al. (2010), SO & Best (2010)). Why non-native speech sounds are so difficult for many adults to learn is due in no small part to the exposure and experience adults have with their native language. Years of experience with a native language allows the adult brain to quickly and effortlessly identify cues in native language speech to categorize speech sounds. However, these native speech sound categories often become so entrenched that they interfere with the learning of non-native speech categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many studies have tried to direct learners attention to specific features in non-native speech sounds in order to overcome native speech sound interference, though most results have been mixed (Bradlow et. al. (1997), Jamieson et. al. 1989, Pisoni et. al. (1994), Pisoni et. al. 1982). Interesting, research by Dr. Lori Holt and colleagues has shown that new auditory categories can be formed by directing learners attention <i>away</i> from to-be-learned auditory categories (Wade & Holt (2005), Lim & Holt (2011), Liu & Holt (submitted)). This type of learning is known as incidental learning as it occurs when participants are engaged in a task which does not primarily dependent on explicit attention to the stimuli being learned. While most of this work has focused on learning non-speech auditory categories, recent work by Liu & Holt (submitted) investigated the efficacy of incidental learning for the purposes of learning non-native language speech categories, specifically Mandarin tonal groups. In addition to training a group participants on Mandarin speech incidentally, a second group of participants was trained on stimuli consisting of isolated Mandarin tones. These stimuli were drawn from recordings of real Mandarin speech but were stripped of all phonetic information. Results from this study showed that both groups were able to generalize to and learn novel Mandarin words with simmilar speed and accuracy. Taken together, this work suggest that incidental learning and the use of non-speech stimuli varying along acoustic dimensions important for the categorization of speech sounds, may provide a \"back door\" through which non-native speech sounds can be learned without interference from native language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <b>Current Study</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the current study was to assess incidental auditory training in individuals  enrolled in a CMU introductory Mandarin course. Participants in this \"classroom intervention\" group (n=9) played a videogame-like task for 1 hour a week over the course of 8 weeks. This task was developed specifically to induce incidental learning of auditory categories. After 8 weeks of training, participants returned to the lab to perform an artifical language learning task over 3 consecutive days. Participants' learning was assessed via the number of correct responses made on a four alternative choice (4AFC) categorization task involving words from this novel language. Accuracy on this task over the course of 3 days served as the main dependent variable of interests\n",
    "\n",
    "Three additional groups were recruited to test several hypotheses. A \"train only\" group (n=7) was formed consisting of individuals not enrolled in introductory Mandarin. However, participants in this group were assigned to play the incidental learning videogame over an 8 week period, just like the classroom intervnetion group, and returned to complete 3 consecutive days of artifical language taks. Comparisons between this group and the classroom intervention group will be performed to determine if classroom instruction and incidental auditory training interact, leading to more robust learning of speech sound categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the train only group, a class only group (n=1), consisting of individuals enrolled in a CMU introductory Mandarin course who have not played the videogame for 8 weeks, was formed as well. Native Mandarin speakers (n=3) were also recruited to perform the artifical language tasks only. Due to the relatively small sizes of these groups, analyses of these participants performance will not take place in the analyses below.\n",

    "### Hypothesis 1:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first hypothesis pertained to participants' baseline Mandarin perceptual abilites, specifically with regards to the Mandarin Speech Sound Discriminiation (MSSD) task. Because the stimuli heard on this task can be differentiated between via simple auditory cues, it was hypothesized that participants in the classroom intervention group and in the training only group would show no differences in MSSD accuracy. To test this hypothesis, mixed effects logistic regression was used. Introductory Mandarin classroom enrollment served as the main variable of interest, while pitch discrimination was included as a covariate. A random effect term was included to account for random variance of the intercept between indviduals.\n",

    "### Hypothesis 2:<br>\n",
    "The second hypothesis pertained to participants' baseline Mandarin tone categorization abilites, specifically with regards to the Mandarin 4-item alternative forced choice (M4AFC) task. Unlike the MSSD task, it was hypothesized that participants enrolled in Introductory Mandarin class will perform better on the M4AFC. This was due simply to the fact that those participants in the class have knowledge of the existence of Mandarin tones, whereas those not enrolled in the class may not. As with the MSSD hypothesis, mixed effects logistic regression was used. Introductory Mandarin classroom enrollment served as the main variable of interest, while pitch discrimination was included as a covariate. A random effect term was included to account for random variance of the intercept between indviduals.\n",
    "\n",

    "The thid hypothesis pertained to participants' performance on the artifical tonal language tasks, specifically accuraccy on 4-item Alternative Forced Choice (T4AFC) administered on all 3-days of post-training evaluation. It was hypothesized the classroom intervention group would outperform the training only group due to more exposure to the tonal groups in a classroom setting. Once again, mixed effects logistic regression was used. Introductory Mandarin classroom enrollment served as the main variable of interest, while pitch discrimination, training time on the incidental learnign video game, and day of testing were included as a covariates. A random effect term was included to account for random variance of the intercept between indviduals.\n",

    "In addition to accuracy measures on the T4AFC, information pertaining to the type of errors made by participants in the T4AFC tasks is available as well. There errors include \"compliment\" errors, which were responses made to an item in the same tone group as the target, \"rhyme\" errors, which were responses made to an item with the same phonetic information as the target, \"distractor\" errors, which were reponses made to an item sharing neither tonal nor phonetic information, and finally \"misses\" which were simply non-responses. A <b>Quadratic Discriminate Anlaysis</b> will be performed to see if pitch discrimination, training time on the incidental learning video game, and day of testing could be used to predict the type of responses made by participants.

    "Gameplay times are variable between participants in this study. How the amount of gameplay time effects TOFU learning is a very important question which is addressed in hypothesis 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "While participants do self-report gameplay times, the server which hosts the Neuraltone game tracks the timing of events in the game relative to when the participant began gameplay. Getting the total gameplay time for a participant involves finding the last event entered for a particular game session. Each game session recieves a unique ID which allows for each game session to be easily parsed from the massive dataset containing all of the logged events for every Neuraltone game ever played. Determining which participant played which game is accomplished by looking at another table which connects game IDs to each participants user ID, which is assigned to each player by the server ({date}_ user_gameid.csv). Unfortunately, the user ID assigned by the server does not match with the participant study ID assigned by the study coordinators; However, a link between user ID and the study ID is kept in a secure file which uses email address to make the connection. User IDs are coded into the participant tracking sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the user IDs from the tracking sheet, the script below finds each of the game IDs associated with that user ID. From there, corresponding game session data is extracted from the gameplay log file ({date}_ loguser_activity.csv). From this extracted data, the last recorded event time is taken. The last event time from each of these game sessions is then summed to yeild the total amount of gameplay for each participant over an 8-week period.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of right now, the sheer size of the time logging table has prevent a proper data auditing technique to be implemented in this script. Right after the cell containing the gameplay time extraction scipt is another script which compares participant self-report gameplay time to gameplay times extracted from the server. While these two times tend to be close to one another, there are certainly some participants who have a sizeable gap between the server time and the reported tiimes. Whether the participant or script itself is at fault is not entirely clear at this time. However, it is believed that the self-report times are most likely the culprit, especially due to the fact that participant compensation increases with increased gameplay time."

    "## Data Extraction Functions\n",
    "The cell below contains three functions: MSSD_data_ripper, M4AFC_data_ripper, and T4AFC_data_ripper. All of these functions operate on E-prime output data. E-prime uses a relatively esoteric text file format. Luckily, there exists an r library, known as rprime, developed for extracting output data from E-prime text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MSSD_data_ripper()\n",
    "\n",
    "This function extracts accuracy data from the Mandarin Speech Same Different task (MSSD). Because responses on this task consist only of \"Same\" or \"Different\", the \"Response.ACC\", or response accuracy field, is the only field which needs to be extracted. As data in this field are simply 1's and 0's, converting these values into qualitiative \"Correct\" and \"Incorrect\" responses was relatively easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### M4AFC_data_ripper()\n",
    "\n",
    "This function extracts accuracy data from the Mandarin 4-item Alternative Forced Choice task (M4AFC). Unlike the previous task set up, there are a total of 4 different response participants can give on the M4AFC task (one for each Mandarin tone group). For whatever reason, E-prime did not include an accuracy field as it had in the MSSD output. However, both participant responses and the correct responses were included as fields in the output file. Therefore, both the participant response and correct response were extracted. Accuracy was then determined by comparing the two matrices. An accuracy vector was built which indicated matches between the two fields with a 1, and non-matches with a 0. From here \"Correct\" and \"Incorrect\" responses were classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### T4AFC_data_ripper()\n",
    "\n",
    "This function extracts accuracy data from the TOFU 4-item Alternative Forced Choice task (T4AFC). It differs significantly from the previous two functions as the only participant measures collected on this task were continuous mouse position and position of mouse during a click. Of importance to this analysis is the clicking location only. Using a lookup table provided by Co-PI Seth Wiener (TOFU-cmu-AOIs-day{number}.csv), the function could determine which symbol the participant had clicked during a particular trial. Then, using a matching procedure similar to the one outline in the M4AFC function above, the function could determine the accuracy of a response for a given trial. Rather than \"Correct\" or \"Incorrect\", responses from this task were classified as \"Correct\", \"Incorrect Consistent\", \"Incorrect Rhyme\", \"Incorrect Distraction\", or \"Incorrect Missing\". For an explanation of these terms, see the study design above\n",

    "The first hypothesis pertained to participants' baseline Mandarin perceptual abilites, specifically with regards to the Mandarin Speech Sound Discriminiation (MSSD) task. Because the stimuli heard on this task can be differentiated between via simple auditory cues, it was hypothesized that participants in the classroom intervention group and in the training only group would show no differences in MSSD accuracy. To test this hypothesis, mixed effects logistic regression was used. Introductory Mandarin classroom enrollment served as the main variable of interest, while pitch discrimination was included as a covariate. A random effect term was included to account for random variance of the intercept between indviduals.\n",

    "The second hypothesis pertained to participants' baseline Mandarin tone categorization abilites, specifically with regards to the Mandarin 4-item alternative forced choice (M4AFC) task. Unlike the MSSD task, it was hypothesized that participants enrolled in Introductory Mandarin class will perform better on the M4AFC. This was due simply to the fact that those participants in the class have knowledge of the existence of Mandarin tones, whereas those not enrolled in the class may not. As with the MSSD hypothesis, mixed effects logistic regression was used. Introductory Mandarin classroom enrollment served as the main variable of interest, while pitch discrimination was included as a covariate. A random effect term was included to account for random variance of the intercept between indviduals.\n",

It was hypothesized the classroom intervention group would outperform the training only group due to more exposure to the tonal groups in a classroom setting. Once again, mixed effects logistic regression was used. Introductory Mandarin classroom enrollment served as the main variable of interest, while pitch discrimination, training time on the incidental learnign video game, and day of testing were included as a covariates. A random effect term was included to account for random variance of the intercept between indviduals.\n",

However, it should be noted that the results from the training data set show that the most common error made by participants was for the \"Competitor\" stimuli. These were stimuli which shared the same tone group as the target stimuli on a trial. This is definetly an avenue work exploring in future analyses. "

    "In this study, two groups of participants were compared. The classroom intervention group consisted of individuals currently enrolled in a CMU introductory Mandarin class who also performed 8 weeks of incidental auditory training on a videogame task. They were compared to a training only group consisting of individuals who were not enrolled in an introductory Mandarin class, though they did perform 8 weeks of incidental auditory training on the same videogame task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyses of the two Mandarin tasks at the initial lab visit strongly indicated an advantage of Mandarin classroom instruction for both Mandarin speech sound discrimination and categorization of Mandarin tone. The latter was not surprising as individuals who were not enrolled in the training group most likely did not have knowlege of these tonal groups like the participants who were in the classroom intervention group. However, it was slightly surprising to see that participants in the classroom interevention had a higher probability of responding correctly on the speed sound discrimination task. The original logic behind our hypothesis was that participants would merely need to attend to acoustic features of the sound to differentiate between Mandarin words. However, it is possible that by rely soley on acoustic features, participants in the training only group may have made more \"Different\" responses than the classroom interevention group, leading to more incorrect responses. The classroom intervention group may have also already had exposure to some of the basic words which were presented during the task. Thus, differences between the utterances of Mandarin speakers might have been ignored by these participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most surprising was the lack of any difference between the classroom intervention group and the training only group with regards to the probability of responding correctly on the artifical language 4-item alternative forced choice tasks. The fact the day of testing variable did seem to have a strong effect on correct response probability makes it unlikely that the stimuli was too hard for the participants to learn. The lack of an effect of gameplay on correct response probability was also rather surprising. That being said, it may be worthwhile to look at the regularity of gameplay time. It is possible that some individuals may have fallen off in their hours by the end of the study, causing learning decay. The server backend for the game does allow for a more nuanced measure of gameplay time, so this is an avenue definetly worth exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it was rather disappointing that the quadratic linear discriminate analysis did not work. Why this occurred seems related to data I was hoping to test the model on. However, it is interesting to note that the largest error made by participants appears to be for stimuli which share the same tone category as the target. This is definetly an avenue I hope to explore as more data becomes available, especially from the native Mandarin speaker group and the introductory Mandarin group that will not train on the video game.
